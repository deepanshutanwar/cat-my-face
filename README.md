# Cat My Face 😸

**Cat My Face** is a real-time face detection and AR overlay project using a **Raspberry Pi and Pi Camera Module**.  
Human faces are detected using OpenCV Haar Cascades, and cat images from a **4×4 sprite matrix** are dynamically overlaid on detected faces.  

This project demonstrates **real-time computer vision on edge hardware** and hands-on experience with Python, OpenCV, and PiCamera2.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using OpenCV Haar Cascades
- 16 cat images from a 4×4 matrix
- Alpha blending and background removal for clean overlays
- Keyboard controls for switching cat overlays
- Multiple faces detection and overlay in a single frame
- Fully runs on Raspberry Pi without cloud dependency

## Technical Overview

1. **Face Detection**
   - Uses OpenCV’s Haar Cascade (`haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml`)
   - Multi-face detection supported
   - Grayscale processing for faster computation

2. **Camera Pipeline**
   - Uses Picamera2 API for live feed
   - RGB frames converted to BGR for OpenCV processing

3. **Cat Overlay**
   - Cat images stored in a 4×4 matrix (`input_cats`)
   - Extracted dynamically using array slicing
   - Overlay size automatically scales to detected face

4. **Background Removal & Alpha Blending**
   - White/near-white pixels are removed
   - Smooth blending with alpha channel

5. **Overlay Application**
   - Resizes cat images to match face dimensions
   - Boundary-safe blending to avoid crashes near edges
